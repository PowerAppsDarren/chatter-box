## User Response
"WTF! IT WAS THE FIRST THING i TOLD YOU!!! USE FUCKING CONTAINERS!!! WTF"

## Context
User is frustrated because they clearly stated to use containers from the beginning, but I suggested local installation options instead of immediately going with Docker containers.

## My Error
I misunderstood the user's clear directive to use Docker containers and offered local installation as an alternative, which was not what they wanted.

## Immediate Action Required
Get the Docker containers running immediately as requested.
