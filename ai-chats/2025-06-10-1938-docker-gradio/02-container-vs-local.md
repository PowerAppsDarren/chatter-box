## User Question
"are we installing everything in containers??????"

## Context
User is questioning whether we should be installing dependencies locally vs in Docker containers. They successfully ran the TTS example locally but hit the Gradio missing dependency issue.

## Current Situation
- User ran `example_tts.py` successfully on local Python 3.13 installation
- Missing Gradio dependency for web interface
- We have comprehensive Docker setup ready to use
- Question is about deployment strategy: local vs containerized

## Response Strategy
Clarify the options and recommend the Docker approach for consistency and isolation.
