# Docker Status Check and Gradio Setup

2025-06-10 19:38:17 (EST)

## User Prompt
User asked about Docker readiness and mentioned being "in the middle of" something. They ran the TTS example successfully but encountered a missing Gradio dependency.

## Analysis
The codebase is Docker-ready with comprehensive setup:
- Complete Dockerfile configurations (GPU and CPU versions)
- Docker Compose with multiple services
- Documentation and startup scripts

## Current Issue
User successfully generated `test-docker.wav` using the TTS example, but Gradio is missing for the web interface:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'gradio'
```

## Next Steps
Need to add Gradio dependency and get the web interface working.
