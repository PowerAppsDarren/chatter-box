# Docker Container Fix

2025-06-10 19:45:16 (CST)

## Human Prompt

Build and run Docker containers for the Chatterbox TTS (Text-to-Speech) system using docker-compose. The user requested to get the containers running immediately without further setup or configuration discussion.

COMPLETED: 
- Initiated Docker container build process using `docker-compose build` command
- Build process started for both chatterbox-cpu and chatterbox-tts containers
- chatterbox-cpu container successfully completed initial setup steps (base image pull, workdir creation, system package installation including build tools, ffmpeg, git, etc.)
- chatterbox-tts container began pulling the PyTorch CUDA base image (pytorch/pytorch:2.6.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-devel)
- Base image downloads progressed significantly (over 1.6GB downloaded for TTS container)

PENDING:
- Fix the PyTorch CPU installation error in chatterbox-cpu container (torch==2.6.0+cpu version not found)
- Complete the docker-compose build process for both containers
- Start the containers after successful build
- Verify the TTS system is running correctly

## AI Response

I need to fix the PyTorch CPU installation error in the chatterbox-cpu container. Let me first examine the current Dockerfile.cpu to see the exact PyTorch version specification that's causing the issue.
