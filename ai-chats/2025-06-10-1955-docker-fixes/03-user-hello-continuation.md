## AI Response
Continuing our Docker fixes work. We have made the following changes:

1. **Fixed Dockerfile.cpu**: Removed duplicate pip install commands and fixed the order of operations
2. **Updated pyproject.toml**: Changed license format from file reference to text format to avoid deprecation warnings

Next steps:
- Test the Docker build to verify our fixes work
- Ensure Gradio is properly installed and accessible
- Validate the complete Docker setup
