Continuing to fix the Docker setup issues. I've already made some initial fixes:

1. **Fixed Dockerfile.cpu** - Removed duplicate pip install commands and reordered operations to copy source code before attempting package installation
2. **Updated pyproject.toml** - Changed license format from `{file = "LICENSE"}` to `{text = "MIT"}` to use modern format

Now I need to continue testing the Docker build to ensure Gradio is properly included and accessible.
