# Docker Fixes Continuation

**2025-06-10 19:55:13 (Eastern Time)**

## User Prompt
Continue working on fixing the Docker setup issues to include Gradio in the dependencies for the chatterbox application. We were working on resolving build failures related to missing files and project structure issues.

## Analysis
Continuing from previous session where we identified several build issues:
1. Missing README.md file referenced in pyproject.toml
2. Missing LICENSE file referenced in pyproject.toml  
3. Deprecated license table format in pyproject.toml
4. Incorrect egg_base option pointing to non-existent 'src' directory
5. SetuptoolsWarning about missing files

The Docker build was failing at the `pip install --no-cache-dir -e .` step due to these project structure problems.
